To answer these 4 questions, you will need to use tcpdump and BPF's against the capstone-bpf.pcap file.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 1:

Using BPFâ€™s, determine how many packets with a DSCP of 26 being sent to the host 10.0.0.103.
tcpdump 'ip[16:4]= 0x0a000067 and ip[1] &252 =104' -r capstone-bpf.pcap | wc -l
Provide the number of packets converted to BASE64.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 2:

What is the total number of fragmented packets?

Provide the number of packets converted to BASE64.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 3:

How many packets have the DF flag set and has ONLY the RST and FIN TCP Flags set?

Provide the number of packets converted to BASE64.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 4:

An attacker is targeting the host 10.0.0.104 with either a TCP full or half open scan. Based off the pcap, how many ports are open?

Provide the number of ports converted to BASE64.
