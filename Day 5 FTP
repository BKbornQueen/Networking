SCP Syntax w/ alternate SSHD
Download a file from a remote directory to a local directory
$ scp -P 1111 student@172.16.82.106:secretstuff.txt .

SCP Syntax through a tunnel
Create a local port forward to target device
$ ssh student@172.16.82.106 -L 1111:localhost:22 -NT
 	(*** -NT locks out the terminal so you do not loose your tunnel)
Download a file from a remote directory to a local directory

local---------------------------.106-----------------------------------<private internal IP of target network>
A--------------------------------B-------------------------------------------C

Dynamic ssh from A to B
			Now able to interact with C via proxy chain scp

without the dynamic (-D option) a normal ssh would only be able to view and interact with box B
Dynamic allows interactions beyond the directly connected(via ssh) box
